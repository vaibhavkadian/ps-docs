>JavaScript is loosely typed which is why you should treat function arguments as simply a naming suggestion for the first X arguments passed.
>>Arguments behaves like an Array but is not of type Array meaning you cannot access Array properties on it except "length".  
>> See [Here](JavaScript/Arguments.html "Effective Use of Arguments") how to use arguments. [Live Ex](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vaibhavkadian/ps-docs/master/JavaScript/Arguments.html "Effective Use of Arguments")

>Type coercion is a fundamental aspect of feature inspection.
