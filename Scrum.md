Scrum Guide ... developed and sustained by Ken Schwaber [scrum.org] and Jeff Sutherland [sruminc.com]

Scrum is a framework for developing and sustaining complex products.

Definition
 A Framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value

Scrum is lightweight , simple to understand, difficult to master

It is not a process or technique rather a framework in which process and techniques can be applied to build products.

Provides clear efficacy of product management and development practices as an input to improvement.

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism, which asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk.

Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control: transparency, inspection, and adaptation.
