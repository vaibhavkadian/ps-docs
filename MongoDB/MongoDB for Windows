MongoDB for Windows

Coming from a windows background, after a lot of head-banging against open-source wall I realized that file path or folder name should not have spaces. This helps in a lot of way, so make it a golden rule.

Download and install NodeJS

Download and install MongoDB msi [http://www.mongodb.org/downloads]
MongoDB Installer will default install @C:\Program Files\MongoDB2.6
Copy the installed MongoDB directory to place you prefer as there are no dependency with it.
Preferable add MongoDB bin directory to SYS ENV path [ex: D:\DevEnv\MongoDB2.6\bin]
Choose a directory where you want to store all database related detials created by mongodb process [ex: D:\DevEnv\Proj]
Create folder as below inside the above choosen direcotry
	data
		db
		log

Now create a configuration file for mongodb folder

echo logpath=D:\DevEnv\Proj\data\log\mongod.log> "D:\DevEnv\MongoDB2.6\mongod.cfg"
echo dbpath=D:\DevEnv\Proj\data\db>> "D:\DevEnv\MongoDB2.6\mongod.cfg"

Create mongod.cfg file should have below lines without """ in it.
logpath=d:\DevEnv\Proj\data\log\mongod.log
dbpath=d:\DevEnv\Proj\data\db

You can also add below line to run mongo service on specific port, but this is optional as mongo.exe will connect with installed service @localhost
port=<port-number>

Install mongo DB service
sc.exe create MongoDB binPath= "\"D:\DevEnv\MongoDB2.6\bin\mongod.exe\" --service --config=\"D:\DevEnv\MongoDB2.6\\mongod.cfg\"" DisplayName= "MongoDB 2.6" start= "auto"

net start mongodb

Use below two command to stop and remove mongodb service
	net stop mongodb
	sc.exe delete mongodb

refer : http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/#windows-8


mongotop [to test mongo install service]
Ctrl+C
mongo [to start interaction with mongo installed service via prompt]

show dbs [to check current avaialble databases]
use <db-name> [to create and start working on specific database, this would be the active db, all further command with prefix db would act on this]
	Database
		Collections [json formatted key/value pairs]

db.createCollection('<collection-name>')

db.<collection-name>.insert({key:value...})
	a key '_id' with unique value of type ObjectId is inserted by default with every collection item.
	_id is 12 bytes hexadecimal number unique for every document in a collection. 12 bytes are divided as follows: 
		_id: ObjectId(4 bytes timestamp, 3 bytes machine id, 2 bytes process id, 3 bytes incrementer)

db.<collection-name>.find()
db.<collection-name>.find().pretty()

db.<collection-name>.remove('')
	remove all items in collection
show collections
	will display all collections create under active database
