    MongoDB for Windows

Coming from a windows background, after a lot of head-banging against open-source wall I realized that file path or folder name should not have spaces. This helps in a lot of way, so make it a golden rule.

Download and install NodeJS

Download and install MongoDB msi [http://www.mongodb.org/downloads]
MongoDB Installer will default install @C:\Program Files\MongoDB2.6
Copy the installed MongoDB directory to place you prefer as there are no dependency with it.
Preferable add MongoDB bin directory to SYS ENV path [ex: D:\DevEnv\MongoDB2.6\bin]
Choose a directory where you want to store all database related detials created by mongodb process [ex: D:\DevEnv\Proj]
Create folder as below inside the above choosen direcotry
  data
    db
    log

Now create a configuration file for mongodb folder

echo logpath=D:\DevEnv\Proj\data\log\mongod.log> "D:\DevEnv\MongoDB2.6\mongod.cfg"
echo dbpath=D:\DevEnv\Proj\data\db>> "D:\DevEnv\MongoDB2.6\mongod.cfg"

Create mongod.cfg file should have below lines without """ in it.
logpath=d:\DevEnv\Proj\data\log\mongod.log
dbpath=d:\DevEnv\Proj\data\d
